Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption technique. Itâ€™s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The method is apparently named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his officials.

Caesar code decryption replaces a letter another with an inverse alphabet shift: a previous letter in the alphabet. Example: Decrypt GFRGHA with a shift of 3. To decrypt G, take the alphabet and look at 3 letters before: D. So G is decrypted with D. To decrypt X, loop the alphabet: before A: Z, before Z: Y, before Y: X.
